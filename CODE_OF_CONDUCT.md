## General communication guidelines

Ulauncher is a free, open source software project developed by a small team of volunteers and contributors.

We are here because we want Ulauncher to improve, and for that we have to:
* Act respectful towards each other.
* Give each other the benefit of the doubt.
* Give and accepting constructive feedback.
* Avoid arguments.
* Learn from past mistakes.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the Ulauncher community. Refrain from trying to "win" arguments or advocate the importance of your specific needs over the needs of others. 
* Leave aside anything that is unhelpful for the Ulauncher progress, such as politics, non-constructive framing/rethorics or anecdotal arguments.

We will not tolerate harassment, personal attacks, derogatory comments, trolling or uncivil behavior. Failure to comply will result in comments being hidden, moderated or removed, and on very serious or repeat offenses as well as refusal to comply users violating our terms will be blocked from the repository.

### Asking for help or requesting changes

We want our time spent contributing to Ulauncher to be as productive and constructive as possible. Please respect that. Do your due diligence before you report issues or contact us asking for help. Read the actual error messages you are getting (if any), and don't ask us about things that are documented or previously covered. We have to prioritize tasks based on how helpful the reports were, and close issues that don't provide enough information. 

1. Our [Readme](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher#readme), [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/issues) and [Dicussions](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/discussions) have many answers, and you should search for these before you ask for help. You can use the GitHub search box (located to the upper left on a desktop computer) to search all of these. If you can't find any information to help there, then it's likely not a Ulauncher issue at all, but an issue with your system, or Ulauncher's dependencies on your system. So please also do a web search to try and understand your issue before you report it.
2. For extension developers, color theme developers or contributors our [Developer resources](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/discussions/879) have more help to offer.
3. If you find an issue and want to show that you agree with a previous comment, use the +1 (thumbs up) reaction. Do not write a comment if you want to repeat something that has already been said or want to know when something will be implemented.
4. Please understand that there are lots of standards, evironments, priorities, use-cases, dependencies and architectural debts/costs that makes software development hard and time-consuming. Ulauncher makes no money and and all of our volunteers are limited to their spare time. You cannot expect, demand, strongarm or debate the importance of your specific concerns. Only those actually volunteering their time to help out have an influence on what is considered high and low priority, what get implemented, how they get implemented and the direction of the project.
5. As a clarification to previous point, we do listen to respectful constructive criticism and matter-of-factly suggestions to change our direction. Just because we went with a decision in the past doesn't mean it's final. Software defelopment is based on making compromises.
